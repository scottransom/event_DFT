.\" cligPart OPTIONS
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -days
Events are in days since MJD0 (default is seconds).
.IP -mjds
Events are in MJDs.
.IP -double
Events are in binary double precision (default is ASCII).
.IP -iout
Send the list of freqs and incoherently summed powers to stdout.
.IP -cout
Send the list of freqs and coherently summed powers to stdout.
.IP -nocoherent
Do not sum powers coherently in the search.
.IP -noincoherent
Do not sum powers incoherently in the search.
.IP -nostatus
Do not print percent complete status to STDOUT.
.IP -fmin
Lowest freq to search (hz),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.br
Default: `0.01'
.IP -fmax
Highest freq to search (hz),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.br
Default: `1000.0'
.IP -fdotbyf
Frequency Derivative / Freq to apply to the events before DFTing,
.br
1 Double value.
.IP -ifs
Approx number of independent freqs in search,
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.IP -mjd0
The fiducial time (in MJD) to use as T0 (default sets T0 to the first event),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.br
Default: `0.0'
.IP -time
The total duration in sec to accept events from the input file (default uses all events),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.br
Default: `0.0'
.IP -start
The fraction of the way through T (beginning at MJD0) to start looking at events (default is 0.0),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.br
Default: `0.0'
.IP -end
The fraction of the way through T (beginning at MJD0) to stop looking at events (default is 1.0),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.br
Default: `1.0'
.IP -offset
A time offset to add to the 1st event in the same units as the events,
.br
1 Double value.
.br
Default: `0.0'
.IP -numsum
Maximum number of harmonics to sum,
.br
1 Int value between 1 and 32.
.br
Default: `8'
.IP -osamp
Factor to oversample normal (1/T) Fourier spacing,

1 Int value between 1 and 1000.
.IP -ncands
Number of candidates to return,
.br
1 Int value between 1 and 1000.
.br
Default: `50'
.IP infile

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page was generated automagically by clig, the
Command Line Interface Generator. Actually the programmer
using clig was supposed to edit this part of the manual
page after
generating it with clig, but obviously (s)he didn't.

Sadly enough clig does not yet have the power to pick a good
program description out of blue air ;-(
